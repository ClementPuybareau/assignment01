# ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Big Data Analytics

#### LSE Methods Summer Programme 2018

## Assignment 1

Download the material for computer class 1 as a zip archive from [this link](https://github.com/lse-me314/assignment01/archive/master.zip).

#### Instructions for Submitting Homeworks

Each homework will be a single file in the [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format.  The files linked below are *named very carefully*, to make it easy for us to identify your completed lab assignments.

1.  Obtaining the starter files.

    Each day below will link the name of a starter file for you to download and work with.  These are in the RMarkdown format.  You should embed your answers, with code, into your version of the instruction files.

2.  Renaming the starter files.

    For example, the first assignment file is named `ME314_assignment1_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.Rmd`, which you will need to rename by replacing the uppercase terms with your own last and first names, e.g.  `ME314_assignment1_Bloggs_Joe.Rmd`.

3.  From RStudio, you can create an HTML output file with your evaluated code, figure, and text answers by clicking the "Knit HTML" button in the top of the editor pane in RStudio.  The resulting HTML file will be saved in your working directory.

4.  You will need to upload the resulting HTML file -- renamed! -- to the [course Moodle page](https://shortcourses.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=158), to the appropriate assignment folder.

We will walk you through this process in the Day 1 lab, so don't worry if it seems complicated the first time.  This sort of careful workflow process and file management is part of learning practical data science too!

We do not mark the homework but we will walk through the solutions at the start of computer labs the following day.
